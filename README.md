So I merged two projects together.

https://github.com/vikhyat/moondream and https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything

I want to combine them better and send their combine information in a nice way to Claude Haiku
I want to use Anthropic tools to make a robot I am building that is connected over wifi have sight.
I should use my phone and the combination of these models with the function calling to perform tasks.

I already have voice communication and tools ready. I just need the tools to connect to the robot next and have the sight work a bit better.
I could use GPT4 vision or Claude Vision but that is expensive.

Just adding two new scripts that can be used to find objects in a video feed. They dont work great but they are I think the first in the world lol
I mean GPT4 cant do it at the moment so I am pretty pleased. Things should run faster so not sure why they arent but I will try update later but please feel
free to take it and use it.
